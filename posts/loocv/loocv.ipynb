        "Cross-validation is a crucial technique in assessing the performance of machine learning models. K-fold cross-validation, a widely-used method, involves dividing the dataset into K subsets, training the model K times, each time using a different subset as the testing set. This helps us gauge how well our model generalizes to unseen data. However, as K increases so does the computational time. This becomes painfully evident, particularly during hyperparameter tuning, where sluggish fits can be a major bottleneck.\n",
        "\n",
        " Leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV), a special case of K-fold cross-validation where K equals the number of training samples, can offer  accurate evaluation but comes at a hefty computational cost, making it less practical for larger datasets and hyperparameter tuning.\n",
        "\n",
        "For linear models like ordinary least squares and ridge regression, a little-known trick exists to efficiently calculate LOOCV scores. scikit-learn even implements this in it's `RidgeCV` estimator. Notably, this same trick extends beyond these linear models to any problem involving quadratically regularized least squares regression—a fact not widely recognized.\n",
        "\n",
        "Taking it a step further, even for non-least-squares models like logistic and Poisson regression, a similar trick can be employed to approximate LOOCV scores efficiently. Intriguingly, the accuracy of this approximation improves with larger datasets, addressing the need for speedup in precisely those scenarios.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this blog post, we derive the formulas for efficient LOOCV calculations and demonstrate these results on a practical example."
