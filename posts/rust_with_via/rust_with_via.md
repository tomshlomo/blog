Over the last two years, I have developed a strong interest in Rust.  
While my day-to-day work primarily involves Python, I have been exploring ways to leverage Rust in our projects.  

A few months ago, I had the opportunity to teach Rust to our algorithms team in a 4-day workshop.  
We based the workshop on Googleâ€™s excellent [Comprehensive Rust](https://google.github.io/comprehensive-rust/) course but made several modifications.  
Most notably, we replaced some exercises and added a new section on using PyO3 to write Python extensions in Rust.  

I was very happy with the results, and I think the team was too.

We have since [published all the materials](https://tomshlomo.github.io/rust-with-via/index.html) and shared a [blog post](https://medium.com/@tomshlomo/teaching-rust-to-python-developers-65709cf4babb) detailing the experience.  

I hope you find these resources valuable!
